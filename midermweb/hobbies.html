            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Weightlifting - I think it is very important to take care of your body as well as your brain, started lifting sophomore year of high school and have been going regularly ever since</li>
                <li>Watching soccer - Truly a passion of mine, unfortunetly didn't work out as a player in High school as I was young and not to mature I had got myself in a fight at school and got kicked off the team. I still love watching my favorite sport, wether it is a professional match or some overweight uncles having a sunday league game </li>
                <li>Hanging out with friends - Can't describe how much I love my boys, sadly half of them are in universities out of town. The best times in my life have been with my friends</li>
                <li>Pondering about random things - I hate it and love it, once I start it is really hard to stop</li>
