        <h2>FC Barcelona Legends</h2>
        <p>FC Barcelona has been home to some of the greatest footballers in the history of the game. These players not only defined their eras but also shaped the club’s identity and global reputation.</p>
        <p>Johan Cruyff was not just a legendary player but also a visionary manager. His influence led to the development of Barça’s attacking philosophy and the creation of La Masia, the club’s elite youth academy.</p>
        <p>Lionel Messi, widely considered the greatest footballer of all time, spent over 20 years at the club. He broke nearly every record imaginable and led Barça to numerous La Liga, Copa del Rey, and Champions League titles.</p>
        <p>Other icons include Ronaldinho, whose flair and joy brought magic back to Camp Nou, and Andrés Iniesta and Xavi, midfield maestros who orchestrated the greatest era in club history under Pep Guardiola.</p>
        <p>These legends built the foundation of what FC Barcelona is today: a club known for brilliance, class, and beautiful football.</p>
