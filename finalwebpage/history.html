        <h2>The History of FC Barcelona</h2>
        <p>FC Barcelona, commonly known as Barça, was founded on November 29, 1899, by a Swiss football enthusiast named Joan Gamper. From the beginning, the club embraced Catalan identity and has always been closely tied to the region’s culture and politics.</p>
        <p>Barça faced adversity during the Spanish Civil War and the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, where expressions of Catalan nationalism were suppressed. Despite the challenges, the club endured and became a symbol of resistance, unity, and pride for the people of Catalonia.</p>
        <p>Over the decades, FC Barcelona became a global football powerhouse. The club’s iconic motto, “Més que un club” (More than a club), reflects its commitment not only to football excellence but also to social causes and democratic values. Major milestones include the arrival of Johan Cruyff in the 1970s, who later returned as a coach to transform Barça’s playing philosophy.</p>
        <p>Under Pep Guardiola’s leadership from 2008 to 2012, Barcelona experienced a golden era with stars like Messi, Xavi, and Iniesta. The team dominated Europe, winning numerous titles including the historic treble in 2009. The tiki-taka style became a benchmark for beautiful and intelligent football.</p>
        <p>Today, FC Barcelona continues to influence world football while staying true to its roots. Whether through thrilling victories, world-class talent, or its deep cultural connection to Catalonia, Barça remains more than a club—it’s a global icon and a beacon of sporting greatness.</p>
